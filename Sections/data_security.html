      <h3>Why invest in Security?</h3>
      <p>
        Private information, company secrets, financial data, computer equipment
        and items of national security are at risk if the security is not
        appropriate.

          <li>Data capture and collection:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              This refers to the process of gathering relevant information that
              can help with security. For instance, it could involve collecting
              data from system logs, user activity, or network traffic.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <li>Data correlation:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              After collecting the data, it’s analyzed and linked together to
              gain deeper insights. This helps identify patterns or anomalies
              that might indicate security risks.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <li>Meaningful reporting:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Once the data is analyzed, it's presented in an understandable and
              actionable format. This allows decision-makers to quickly identify
              issues and take appropriate steps to address them.

    <h2>What is the CIA Triad?</h2>
    <div>
      <p>The Cia Triad is composed of several Components.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- new section -->
    <div class="info-container">
      <p>
        We will first go over <strong>Confidentiality</strong>. What does this
        actually mean? Well, let's say you give your information to a bank to
        get a loan. One of the things they might ask for is your Social Security
        number, which is not something you want to give out freely. In the
        context of the CIA Triad, <strong>confidentiality </strong> refers to
        protecting sensitive data so that only authorized people can access it.
        Businesses use techniques like encryption, passwords, and access
        controls to maintain <strong>Confidentiality</strong>, ensuring that
        only the right people can view or use the data—keeping information
        private and secure.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="info-container">
      <p>
        Second Component in the CIA Triad is <strong>Integrity</strong>. This
        ensures that information stay authentic and is trustworthy, basically
        means that the data is not altered or tampered with by unauthorized
        individuals. It Guarantees that the information received is exactly as
        it was inteded, preventing it from improperly modified, corrupted or
        destroyed. Techniques like hashing, checksums, and digital signatures
        are often used to maintain integrity, ensuring that changes to the data
        can be detected and verified. Essentially,
        <strong>integrity </strong> keeps information accurate and reliable.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="info-container">
      <p>
        We will cover the last one called <strong>Availability </strong>. It is
        when the company takes measures to ensure that data and systems are
        accessible whenever needed by authorized users. For example, if a
        company’s server goes down, <strong>Availability</strong> measures like
        backups, redundancy (multiple servers), and load balancing come into
        play to keep the system online. <strong>Availability</strong> also
        involves keeping systems up-to-date and protected against threats like
        Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, ensuring continuous access
        to information.
