                In short, cybersecurity is a crucial aspect of the 21st century and will
                continue to be essential for businesses. You wouldn’t want your bank
                information or medical records exposed to the world, right? If that
                concerns you, it should, because companies must uphold their
                responsibility to protect your data. Businesses should safeguard their
                assets—including hardware, software, and data—just as they protect their
                customers. With the rise of cyberattacks and the evolving tactics of
                cybercriminals, data and information assets are increasingly vulnerable
                to theft. The information at risk is often highly valuable to those who
                have no legitimate reason to access it.
