              <h1>  Basics of network communication </h1>
              <h3> What is a packet?  </h3>
              <p>
                  We will start with a packet, a packet is a small unit of data transmitted over the network. This basically means that if i send something over the internet then the data of that information gets broken into smaller data so that its more efficient, reliable and flexible.
                </p>
                <div class="order-list">
                    <ol>
                        <li>Efficiency</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                              it allows for multiple devices to share a network, simultaneously  as the packets can be transmitted independently.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <li> Reliability </li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                              if a packet is lost or corrupted during transmission, then only that specific packet needs to be resent, this is good because this helps reduce overall data transmission time
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>Flexibility</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                              Packets can take different paths through a network, ensuring that data can reach its destination even if there are network failures or congestion.
                               The great thing about this is it's flexible i say this because packets can take different paths through a network, this ensures that data can reach the destination even if there are network failures.

              <h3> What is a DNS?  </h3>
              <p>
                  DNS Stands for Domain Name System and a URL to IP Translation. WHat does this mean? Well url and IP are interconnected concepts that play a crucial role in how we access websites on the internet.
                </p>

                            <li>
                              DNS is a hierarchical distributed naming system, you can think of it like the hierarchy in the romans. 
                              Translate human-readable domain names into numerical IP addresses.  
                            </li>

                            <li>
                              DNS is the primary tool used for URL-to-IP translation.
                              When your computer needs to access a website, it sends a DNS query to resolve the URL into an IP address
